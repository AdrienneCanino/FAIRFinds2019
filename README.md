# FAIRFinds2019
Datasets, code scripts, and some example files from a brief presentation given at Library 2.019 Open Data Presentation, June 5 2019. The Presentation was FAIR Finds, applying the Fair Principles to a project resulting in data visualizations for HABs in NYS.

## Library 2.019?
"The future of libraries in the digital age" educational opportunity for data enthusiasts, library professionals, information professionals, etc. Find out more : https://www.library20.com/open-data 

## FAIR principles?
FAIR is an acronym to provide guidelines in sharing data that is truly accessible and re-usable. Find out more here: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/


## HABS?
This project was about getting data from the New York State (USA) Department of Envionrmental Conservation about Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) on waterbodies across the state. I found the data, but it didn't meet all of the FAIR guidelines at first. This presentation explores how this is a case study of getting opendata into 'FAIR' shape. :)

# Materials
Inside, there are csv files that are examples of data that I used in this project. There is an R script with an example data visualization output that was used to make the treemap in this project. My final poster is included from the class this project was submitted to. There is also a zip file with the presentation materials from the June 5th presentation.
